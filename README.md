# Supervisat_Regressio
Sprint 9 Task 2 - Supervised Regression

Let's practice and become familiar with regressions

Level 1
- Exercise 1
Create at least three different regression models to try to predict DelayedFlights.csv's flight delay (ArrDelay) as best as possible.

- Exercise 2
Compare them based on MSE and R2.

- Exercise 3
Train them using the different parameters they support.

- Exercise 4
Compare your performance using the train / test approach or using all data (internal validation)


Level 2
- Exercise 5
Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction


Level 3
- Exercise 6
Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions
